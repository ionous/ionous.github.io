U've been working on the composer side of things -- ( https://github.com/ionous/makisu ) fixing bugs, and getting the [imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming) programming side of things working ( in iffy it will primarily be used for event handlers, and pattern execution. )

My near term goal is to take a simple unit test from the composer and make it runnable at the command line. From there, to add in the runtime memory model for changing the properties of nouns, to add in the main game loop, and user input parser.

Basically, to get a simple game running.


The world's second most simplest unit test. <br>
