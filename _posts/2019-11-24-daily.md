my paid work has been calming down as it gets closer to release. 

normally, that'd be the opposite -- and the week before last *was* a stressful run --
but, my area of things is pretty much done and, being a contractor, i'm isolated from the ui and gameplay issues that exist.

for my story editor, i have a first pass of the first set of controls using test data.

now, it's time i think to create "directives" to help create the real data, and see how the editing experience is.

i anticipate a bunch of sloggy bugs. recursive tree structures tend to make my brain hurt.
