there are days which take my full attention continuously, and yet i feel like -- at the end of them -- i got nothing done.

programmer and designer support is some of that. sometimes there is a wall of slack messages to attend to. and when i get done with one set, a new wall quickly appears. 

no, i did not break the build. the drive ran out of disk space again. it's right there in the log. -- but then, everyone is equally busy so no one had time to look.

my own responses, contribute to other people's walls. and the cycle continues. all. day.

that's the way of it. people get blipping at each other, and then everyone's time is getting eaten up in the blips. 

fortunately, today is the start of my weekend. which means... time to go to work at my other job. and i wonder how *did* i get all this grey hair.
