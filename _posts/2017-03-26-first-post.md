Looking at possibly using github pages to host some of my blog content. 
Currently, i use blogger, unfortunately it isn't great at styling code. 
Since that's what i [write about](http://dev.ionous.net), blogger can be a pain.

At any rate, following [this tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/), which is nicely written. Very straightfoward.
