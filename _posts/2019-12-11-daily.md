the other day after writing unit tests for mutations, 
i got stuck on trying to figure out how exactly the ui should work --
![mutator ui]({{site.url}}/assets/2019-12-11/mutator-box.png)

i came up with the idea of using slash (/) commands 
( like irc or slack, quake console, etc. ) to modify the story instead.

i like that it keeps the focus on text, 
leverages the existing autocomplete input box,
and removes the need for fiddly ui work.

![slash command ui]({{site.url}}/assets/2019-12-11/slash-cmds.png)

as a bonus, it seems to work okay in my simple tests.
so what next?

paths for work are:

* undo/redo - you don't realize how much you use it till it doesn't exist. 
* save/load - either a single story or several.
* bug fixing - cause there definitely are some.
* language improvements - trying to make the language understandable.
* style improvements - everything's fairly ugly right now.
* story creation - verifying that i can re/create some inform-like stories.

factors are: if the whole approach doesn't work, it's not worth spending more time on. sharing it with other people requires basic usability features. the ultimate goal remains recreating stories as complex as [alice](https://evermany.itch.io/alice).

spending too much time figuring out what to do is its own issue.
i think i'll at least scope undo/redo and save/load to make story creation and language improvement easier.

see that wasn't too bad, was it?
