for my story engine editor, trying to see how optional elements can be represented.
it's easier to have a handle for editing something when something exists than when it does not.

blockly does it with mutator controls, which i find confusing. 
they don't show a user _where_ something will appear; it's spatially disconnected.

i have an [editing spec](https://github.com/ionous/makisu/wiki/TypeSpecs) shaping up. 

i think what will happen is that the serialized instance model will have to expand into
an intermediate format suitable for [vue](https://vuejs.org/) ( ex. array elements as primitive values, strings in serialized arrays; elements as objects with key/ids for vue. )

a cached linear list of leaf nodes pulled that intermediate format to determine "neighbors" for adding elements to blank spaces. so i guess, optional spots would have to appear in the intermediate format...?

anyway, that's what i'm pondering today.

( also, had a student interview me today about the video game industry. that was somewhat novel. hope they got the info they wanted. maybe just a passing grade ;)  )
