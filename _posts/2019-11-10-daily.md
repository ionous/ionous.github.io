i have no idea what my method is right now.

i spent ( too ) long ( trying ) to make [blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/) work, sweeping under the rug issues i saw ( from the beginning ):

* blocks can't line wrap.
* mutator buttons are odd, hard to understand.
* the palette doesn't change based on context.

`long lines`

and things i ran into along the way:

* lines with nesting look jittery
* you need custom code (why?) to write mutations ( and it's often non-trivial )
* writing story text should be easy; block snapping wasn't doing it for me.
* too many formats needed for describing blocks: xml, json, javascript.
* mismatches b/t the described formats and blockly's internal representation ( msg/arg blocks; fields start as peers of inputs, but become children of inputs ) and those mismatches make blockly hard to alter ( [leaky abstractions](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/) ) 

`jagged lines`

i really wanted to use something off the shelf. it just didn't come together.

so now i am trying to write a custom story editor. only.... how?

basically, i started by first describing the json format i would have wanted for blockly; then working on some (pen-and-paper) ui concepts ( especially around how to handle the things blockly does poorly: optional and repeating values ); and now, trying to figure out how to make all that happen.

baby steps. hoping that -- unlike my attempt at a blockly editor -- those steps pan out. ( noting that working with blockly, seeing what worked and what didn't, and having to work through formalizing a grammar -- were all good steps in and of themselves. )
