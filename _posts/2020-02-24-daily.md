After getting an very basic web view of an assembled story database -- the (atlas)[https://github.com/ionous/iffy/tree/master/cmd/atlas] -- working. I'm working on getting the imperative programming bits editable. Something that looks maybe along the lines of the Warcraft3 trigger editor.

( example script from this [tutorial](http://world-editor-tutorials.thehelper.net/dialogs.php) )


Of course, even though _in theory_ new commands should work seamlessly -- they do not. Early days...

My solution? Work on the adding new functionality, a command browser, a context window, and the like --
to trick my brain back into being okay with the "it should already be working" bug hunt.
